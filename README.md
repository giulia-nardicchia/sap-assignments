### Assignment #3 - From Layered to  Ports & Adapters / Hexagonal Architecture

- **Description:** Consider the (partial) implementation of the E-Scooters case study discussed in lab [20231013](https://github.com/pslab-unibo/sap-2023-2024/blob/master/Labs/Lab-04-20231013/README.md), based on a layered architecture. The objective of the assignment is to:
    - revise the design by applying a [Ports & Adapters / Hexagonal Architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PomKasGfZQuLNWwfVzK-DS-SLcZk_oKniPfgVKsSd8U/edit?usp=sharing)
    - add a port and one adapter to enable the possibility to monitor the number of ongoing rides (e.g. a dashboard for EScooters management)
    - add an adapter for a concrete DB technology (examples can be MongoDB or MySQL)
